# TODO
- Find a better way to keep track of exercises. (assume this file is never up ot date)
- Update exercises from week 1-3 with better file-names to better suit the styleguide (short names)

# Reminders
- Keep test-functions in a separate file beginning with "test_"

# Styleguide
## General formatting
- Indent by 4 spaces, do not use tabs
- Avoid lines longer than 79 characters (although this limit is moving up ...)
- When wrapping long lines, use parentheses to keep things together
- Separate top-level functions and classes by two blank lines,
- class methods should be separated by one blank line
- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.
- Use UTF-8 encoding
- Put imports on separate lines at the top of the file
## Naming conventions
- Module (file) names should be short and written in all lowercase. Underscores are allowed and often used to separate different words.
- Function names should be all lowercase with parts separated by underscore (count_words())
- Variable names: same as function names
- Class names: should normally use the CapWords convention. (FunctionIntegrator).
- Constants: all uppercase, parts separated by underscore (MAX_WEIGHT)
- Never use l, O, or I (lowercase l, uppercase o, uppercase i) for single-letter names. These can be easy to confuse for others characters, or downright indistinguishable in some fonts.
